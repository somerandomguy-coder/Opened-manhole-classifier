# Opened-manhole-classifier
Classifier using deep learning architecture to detect if a manhole on the street is properly closed or it's opened


## Framework and library
This project is built using the following key Python libraries:

PyTorch: The core deep learning framework.

torchvision: A library for working with vision data in PyTorch, including transforms and a custom Dataset class.

pandas: Used for reading and handling the CSV file with image labels.
